# bmicalculator
This program is a BMI Calculator made in Python with a Tkinter GUI. This was my first ever coding program made in my Software Development class in 2016. The code is messy, but does work! The settings page being written to a Database has no use currently, but it was a specification of the project to have to put in. 

# Requirements
